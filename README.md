# Instagrid_OC

Instagrid is a project developed by OpenClassrooms.
As part of project 4 of my training course, it is up to me to improve it. 
So you can find here my version of the project.

State : "I am a mobile developer in a large IT company.
My new mission is to develop "Instagrid". It is an application that allows to combine several photos in a square format and to share the result with his friends via his favorite applications."
